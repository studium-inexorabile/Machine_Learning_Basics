# Machine_Learning_Basics
<em>A few Python programs to showcase some fundamentals of Machine Learning.</em>

<b>irisDataKKN.py</b> - 
I use the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the species of 
an iris given the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

<b>irisDataLR.py</b> - 
I use the logistic regression algorithm to predict the species of an iris
given the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

<b>modelSelection.py</b> - 
I systematically determine the best model to use based on splitting the 
data into train and test. I apply this first to the logistic regression algorthm.
I then test different values (between 1-30) to use for K in the the k-nearest 
neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

<b>k-foldCrossValidation.py</b> - 
I use K-fold cross validation to shuffle my training and testing sets and 
calculate accuracy scores for the K value in the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.
